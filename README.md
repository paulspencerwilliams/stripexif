# stripexif

Utility which allows me to strip exif tags before uploading photos to social media

Originally, I'd have liked this script to by JVM based to allow portability, 
so I endeavoured to use Apache Commons Imaging to strip the tags. However, I 
discovered and reported [this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMAGING-299)
that prevented this approach. I subsequently retreated back to wrapping Exifinfo via Docker. 

## Installation

Clone from Github

    $ git clone git@github.com:paulspencerwilliams/stripexif.git

Build Docker file

    $  docker build -t exiftool .

## Usage

    $ clojure -M:run-m

To verify change use this command
    $ docker run -v "$PWD":/tmp exiftool  /tmp/a.jpg /tmp/b.jpg -G1 -w txt
    $ diff a.txt b.txt
